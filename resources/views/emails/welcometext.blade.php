Hi {{$name}},

This is Mr. Petition. Thanks for signing up on my website and becoming my friend :)

Since you are my friend, I can share my secret with you - I have an OCD for raising petitions and requesting things from strangers.

Well, strangers mostly shoo me away when I go to them but I know you, being my friend, will definitely fulfill my simple requests - won't you?

Don't worry, I only have two very simple requests:

1. Like my facebook page (or twitter page or both)

Facebook page - http://facebook.com/mrpetition

2. Share one of my petitions (which you've liked the most) with your facebook/twitter friends

So, that's it. Stay tuned to www.mrpetition.com for more of my insane petitions. You can also browse a few of my favorite ones below.

Thanks,
Mr. Petition
